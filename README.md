# The Adventure of Bart

A Scratch and JavaScript-based Social Studies project from a while back. It's cornier than rurla Indiana, but you're welcome to fire it up and play it. This project saved my grade, so I'm pretty proud of it still, even after a couple years.

## Information
This is an old social studies project, kept around almost solely for the purpose of proving to other people that I actually did this as a Social Studies project.
